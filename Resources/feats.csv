***Cavalier Pledges***
:> Many cavaliers pledge themselves in service to a specific organization or individual, such as a noble family or sovereign ruler, a knightly order or another organization, or a particular ideal. A cavalier pledged to an order or ideal must uphold its edicts and is beholden to any anathema it has; for example, a cavalier pledged to the druid’s animal order would be tied to that anathema, while a cavalier pledged to the church of Abadar would be held to the same standards as a cleric of that god. If you pledge yourself to an entity or cause without a stated anathema, you should work with your GM to determine the edicts and anathema associated with your pledge.
:> Cavaliers who have pledged themselves can gain access to certain abilities related to that pledge, such as Cavalier’s Banner. If you violate the anathema of your pledge, you lose access to those feats until you benefit from an atone ritual. Changing the subject of your pledge is equivalent to retraining a class feature.","You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the cavalier archetype.

Checks to (action: Recall Knowledge) about one of your identities don’t reveal information about the other unless the person attempting the check knows both identities are the same person. Effects that detect you based on your identity, such as the (spell: detect alignment) spell, work only if you are currently in the identity the effect is trying to detect; otherwise, the effect fails as if the target didn’t exist.
To maintain the separation between your identities, some of your abilities have one of two traits: (trait: social) or (trait: vigilante). You can use social feats only while in your social identity. Your class feats and vigilante feats are associated with your vigilante identity, and using them while in your social identity risks exposing you as a vigilante. This means that if you were particularly meek or inconspicuous before you took this feat, your identity could be at greater risk of exposure. If your identity is exposed to the public, you lose the benefits of Vigilante Dedication to disguising yourself, but you can otherwise use both (trait: social) and (trait: vigilante) abilities in either identity unless they rely on your identity being a secret. You can use feats that don’t have either trait regardless of your current identity.","You can’t select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the vigilante archetype.",0,0,NULL,NULL,"GIVE-NOTES-FIELD=Use this area to keep information about your identities.",0,NULL,NULL,0,ADV-PLAYER-GUIDE,NULL,1.0,"2020-08-18 19:27:19","2020-08-18 19:27:19"

You need the (feat: Alchemical Crafting) skill feat to create alchemical items, the (feat: Magical Crafting) skill feat to create magic items, and the (feat: Snare Crafting) skill feat to create snares.
To Craft an item, you must meet the following requirements:
* : The item is your level or lower. An item that doesn’t list a level is level 0. If the item is 9th level or higher, you must be a master in Crafting, and if it’s 16th or higher, you must be legendary.
* : You have the formula for the item.
* : You have an appropriate set of tools and, in many cases, a workshop. For example, you need access to a smithy to forge a metal shield.
* : You must supply raw materials worth at least half the item’s Price. You always expend at least that amount of raw materials when you Craft successfully. If you’re in a settlement, you can usually spend currency to get the amount of raw materials you need, except in the case of rarer precious materials.
You must spend 4 days at work, at which point you attempt a Crafting check. The GM determines the DC to Craft the item based on its level, rarity, and other circumstances.
If your attempt to create the item is successful, you expend the raw materials you supplied. You can pay the remaining portion of the item’s Price in materials to complete the item immediately, or you can spend additional downtime days working on it. For each additional day you spend, reduce the value of the materials you need to expend to complete the item. This amount is determined using Table 4–2: Income Earned (page 236), based on your proficiency rank in Crafting and using your own level instead of a task level. After any of these downtime days, you can complete the item by spending the remaining portion of its Price in materials.

The GM might determine an attunement applies as long as it’s prevalent enough around you. For instance, you might be in aquatic terrain on a riverbank or on a boat. Similarly, one place might count as multiple types of terrain, such as a mountain in the far north being both arctic and mountain. In this case, you choose only one terrain attunement effect, even if the spell has traits that would apply to each terrain type.
Certain terrain attunements affect your enemies instead of you.

These enemies receive the listed saving throw against your spell DC to attempt to avoid the effect.

* Arctic: ((trait: cold)) Arctic rime covers your foes’ bodies. Enemies must attempt a Fortitude save. They take a –5-foot status penalty to their Speeds for 2 rounds (–10-foot on a critical failure).
* Desert: ((trait: fire)) The scorching heat of the desert dehydrates your foes. Enemies must attempt a Fortitude save. On a failure, they’re fatigued until they drink water or another potable liquid.
* Forest: ((trait: plant)) Branches and vines reach out to get in your foes’ way. Enemies must attempt a Reflex save. On a failure, they become clumsy 1 for 1 round (clumsy 2 on a critical failure).
* Mountain: ((trait: earth)) The rugged endurance of the mountain protects you from harm. You gain resistance to physical damage (except adamantine) equal to the spell level for 1 round.
* Plains: ((trait: plant)) The growing fields and pulsing vitality of the plains provide you vigor. You gain temporary Hit Points equal to the spell level for 1 round.
* Sky: ((trait: air)) A gust of wind carries you aloft. You can (action: Fly) up to 10 feet. If you’re in the air at the end of the turn and don’t have a fly Speed, you fall.
* Swamp: ((trait: plant)) Your magic draws in noxious swamp gas to fumigate your foes. Affected foes take persistent poison damage equal to half the spell’s level (minimum 1 damage) with a basic Fortitude save.
* Underground: ((trait: earth)) The endless darkness of the cavern depths opens up its secrets to your senses.

Your construct companion has the (trait: minion) trait, and it gains 2 actions during your turn if you use the (action: Command a Minion | Command an Animal) action to command it.
If your companion is destroyed, you can spend 1 day of downtime and attempt a Crafting check with a high DC for your level. On a success, you rebuild your companion. You can have only one construct companion at a time, and you can have either a construct companion or an animal companion, but not both.

***Riding Construct Companions***
You or an ally can ride your construct companion as long as your construct companion is at least one size larger than the rider.

***Prototype Construct Companions***
The following are the base statistics for a prototype construct companion, the first construct companion most characters get. A companion has the same level you do. As you gain levels, you might make further adjustments as your companion grows more powerful. Construct companions calculate their modifiers and DCs just as you do, with one difference: the only item bonuses they can benefit from are to Speed.

**Construct Trait**
A construct companion has the (trait: construct) trait. It’s not a living creature, nor is it undead.

**Proficiencies**
Your construct companion is trained in its unarmed attacks, unarmored defense, all saving throws, Perception, Acrobatics, and Athletics. Construct companions can’t use abilities that require greater Intelligence, such as Coerce or Decipher Writing, even if trained in the appropriate skill, unless they have an ability that allows it.

**Size**
Your construct companion is either Small or Medium, chosen by you when you first gain the companion.

**Strikes**
Your construct companion has two kinds of melee unarmed attacks. Its first unarmed attack deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage. Depending on the shape of your construct this could be a fist, tendril, or other similar unarmed attack. Its other unarmed attack deals 1d6 slashing or piercing damage (choose when you first gain the companion) and has the agile and finesse traits. Depending on the shape of your construct, this could be a spine or spike, jaws or fangs, a retractable blade, or other similar unarmed attack.

**Ability Modifiers**
A construct companion begins with base ability modifiers of Str +3, Dex +3, Con +2, Int –4, Wis +1, Cha +0.

**Hit Points**
Your construct companion has 10 Hit Points, plus a number of Hit Points equal to 6 plus its Constitution modifier for each level you have.
While constructs are usually immediately destroyed at 0 Hit Points, your construct companion is a little harder to destroy than other constructs are. When your construct reaches 0 Hit Points, it becomes broken and begins sparking and might be destroyed if you don’t Repair it. This works the same as the normal dying rules and determines if your construct is destroyed, with the following two changes. First, most effects that end the dying condition don’t work to save a construct companion, but a construct can be stabilized using the Administer First Aid action, using the Crafting skill instead of Medicine. Second, instead of gaining and tracking the wounded condition, if your construct becomes broken in this way more than twice within a 10-minute period, it’s destroyed, and you’ll need to reconstruct it by spending a day of downtime.

**Immunities**
Because it’s a construct, your construct companion is immune to bleed, death effects, disease, doomed, drained, fatigued, healing, necromancy, nonlethal attacks, paralyzed, poison, sickened, and unconscious. Because the construct isn’t a living creature, effects that heal living creatures can’t help it recover Hit Points. Restoring Hit Points to it requires using the Repair action or other means that can restore Hit Points to objects and nonliving creatures.

**Senses**
Your construct companion has precise vision, imprecise hearing, and vague touch senses, but no sense of smell or taste.

**Speed**
Your construct companion has a Speed of 25 feet.

***Advanced Construct Companions***
To advance a prototype construct companion to an advanced construct companion (usually a result of one of your class feat choices), make the following adjustments.
* : Increase its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and Wisdom modifiers by 1.
* : Increase its unarmed attack damage from one die to two dice (for instance, 1d8 to 2d8).
* : Increase its proficiency rank for Perception and all saving throws to expert.
* : Increase its proficiency ranks in Intimidation, Stealth, and Survival to trained. If the construct is your innovation and it was already trained in those skills from a modification, increase its proficiency rank in those skills to expert.
* : You can change your companion’s Size, if you want, to either Small, Medium, or Large.

***Incredible Construct Companions***
To improve an advanced construct companion to an incredible construct companion, make the following adjustments.
* : Increase its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution and Wisdom modifiers by 2.
* : It deals 2 additional damage with its unarmed attacks. Its attacks become magical, allowing it to bypass resistances to non-magical attacks.
* : Increase its proficiency ranks in Athletics and Acrobatics to expert.

***Paragon Construct Companions***
To improve an incredible construct companion to a paragon construct companion, make the following adjustments.
* : Increase its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and Wisdom modifiers by 1.
* : Increase its proficiency rank for unarmed attacks and unarmored defense to expert.
* : Increase its proficiency ranks for Athletics, Acrobatics, saving throws, and Perception to master.
* : Increase its unarmed attack damage from two dice to three dice, and its additional damage with unarmed attacks from 2 to 4.",NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,0,GUNS-AND-GEARS,NULL,1.0,"2021-10-10 20:32:10","2021-10-10 20:32:10"

While your sterling dynamo prosthetic can replace a missing prehensile limb, such as an arm, choosing to add a new limb can never increases your character’s number of hands or prehensile limbs beyond two, even in combination with other abilities or effects.
Your sterling dynamo prosthesis is especially optimized for combat, granting you a dynamo melee unarmed attack that is in the brawling weapon group and is made of silver (which makes it more effective against certain types of creatures, such as devils and werewolves).

Most dynamos are automated, so they don’t require a free hand to use, like other (trait: unarmed) attacks. However, you can instead choose to make your dynamo be manually controlled via a handheld switch, lever, or other device; to make an attack with a manually controlled dynamo, you must have a hand free to operate it, but the benefit is great control and a more devastating strike. This increases the damage die by one size, to a 1d8 for a power drive dynamo or 1d6 for a percussive striker dynamo. Arm dynamos are always manual, but they use the hand on that arm to operate the dynamo when making strikes. Manual control is required only in the heat of combat, not for less strenuous adventuring or everyday activities.
